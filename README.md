# Colors hidden in the Snow
A very small game made using the Wasabi2D framework for the Pygame Community New Years Jam.

In the picture below, you can see the game :

The map is procedurarely generated, so this is only an example and the map will not be the same each try.

As described in the main menu, the goal is to find all the hidden relics.
When you are close enough to one, you screen will begin to fade to that color.

In the next picture, we can see a situation where the snowman (your character) is really close to the green relic !

Hope this game would be as fun as its development has been.
